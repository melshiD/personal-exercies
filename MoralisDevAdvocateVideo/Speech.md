Hi, I'm David.

When I'm not engaged in writing blockchain poetry,
learning new JS libraries, or getting my community
excited and educated about blockchain,
I bootstrap all that as a realestate photographer and
digital manufacturing consultant.

These are noble professions, but think
how we'd florish if I spent that time
growing as a developer, transferring my excitement
and knowledge to my peers, and helping lead
our future towards ever sweeter Daps?

But where can begin to find the road
to sweeter daps?

From where can one reach the greatest
number of web2 and web3 brothers and sisters?

I know where... Middleware.
And cloud as my whitness, we will
build firmly on middleware

Let us teach the masses together, and
let me show them the tools.

We will BIDL a better future together.

Roll credits.

Sorry, forgot the parens.
